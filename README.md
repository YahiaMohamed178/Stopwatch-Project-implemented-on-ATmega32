This stopwatch project uses the ATmega32 Timer1 in compare mode to count time.
The project utilizes external interrupts that provide the capabiity to stop, resume and reset the stopwatch.
The stopwatch also supports counting down mode where the user sets a certain time and it counts down from it till it reaches 00:00:00 and then an alarm buzzer goes off to alert the user.
The src & elf files of the project are provided as well as the Proteus schematic.
